# **Moon Lander Using Q-Learning**

Welcome to the Moon Lander project! This project implements a Moon Lander using the Q-Learning algorithm, allowing the lander to autonomously navigate and land on the lunar surface.

## **Overview**

The Moon Lander is a classic reinforcement learning problem where the goal is to safely land a spacecraft on the surface of the moon. In this project, we utilize Q-Learning, a popular reinforcement learning technique, to train the lander to make optimal decisions and achieve successful landings.

## **Features**

- Implementation of Q-Learning algorithm.
- Simulation environment for the Moon Lander.
- Autonomous navigation and landing capabilities.

## **Installation**

To run the Moon Lander project, you need Python installed on your system. You also need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this using pip:


## **Usage**

1. Run the main script to start the Moon Lander simulation:


2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the simulation.
